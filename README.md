# 🖥️ Work OS

Welcome to **Work OS** – the ultimate* enterprise-grade** solution for session management, idle detection, and cross-tab synergy.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Launch the productivity engine:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.**
   - For maximum synergy, open several tabs at once.

---

## 🧪 How It Works

- Open multiple tabs. Log in or out in one tab—watch all tabs update instantly!
- Stay active and your session will auto-renew. Go idle for 10 seconds and you’ll see a warning (you have another 10 seconds to get back to work). You have three warnings before getting logged out after the idle expiration time.
- Try to visit a protected page without logging in? You’ll be redirected to the login page.
